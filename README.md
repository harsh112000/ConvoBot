# ConvoBot
ConvoBot is a Chrome extension that seamlessly transfers your ChatGPT conversations to other AI platforms when you hit message limits. It automatically detects when you've reached ChatGPT's usage cap, extracts and summarizes your conversation, then helps you continue the discussion on Claude, Gemini, or other AI tools without losing context.
